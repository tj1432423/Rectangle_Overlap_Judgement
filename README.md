# Rectangle_Overlap_Judgement

Created by Daike Kang for the overlap judgement of rectangle.

The line and point are all the special case of Rectangle, which are all supported.

The opencv lib is needed in this project.

It is still under continuous improvement.

Looking forward for your advices.

Thanks for your reading!
